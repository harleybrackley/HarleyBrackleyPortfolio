            I am always looking for new and interesting challenges and ways to
            use my skills help create real solutions with a positive impact. I
            have recently completed General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering
            Immersive Course, a 12 week full time bootcamp where I have
            developed a strong understanding of both front end and back end
            technologies. Through my experience as a Surgical Instrument
            Technician, I bring strong attention to detail and critical thinking
            with a methodical approach to problem solving.
